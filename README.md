# Catalog Integration

This repo is intended to show how the Postman API can be integrated into a pre-existing API catalog.

This is intended to be as lightweight example as possible that isn't opinionated on any specific type of implementation.

# Main goals of this integration

When adding an API to your catalog in the form of an API definition:

- create the API in Postman
- add it to Postman's catalog (Private API Network)
- spin up or use an existing Postman Workspace for this API
- create a mock server that reflects the provided API definition

# Example
